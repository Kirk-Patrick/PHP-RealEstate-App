Tools:
In debbugging the application, PHP Tools for visual studio was used in order to take advantage of the Great debugging capabilities of visual Studio.

NB. Due to not being a requirement in the specification. The password field was not encrypted, but in a real application this is imperative.In addition a more sophisticated System of user membership should be used similar to asp.net membership System
